ITVE – Frontend Website Redesign

This project is a frontend redesign of the Institute of Technical & Vocational Education (ITVE) website.
The goal was to create a modern, clean, and easy-to-use interface that helps students explore technical courses and understand career options more clearly.

This project was developed as part of the ITVE Frontend Development Assessment.

Project Overview

The website focuses on:

Clear presentation of ITVE programs

Smooth navigation between sections

A responsive layout that works on all screen sizes

A simple and structured user experience for students

Tech Stack Used

HTML5 – Page structure

Vanilla JavaScript – Interactions and section tracking

Tailwind CSS – Styling and responsive design

How to Run Locally

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/farrukhh31/ITVE-Assessment-Frontend-Development-.git


Open the project folder:

cd ITVE-Assessment-Frontend-Development-


Open index.html in your browser
(or use Live Server in VS Code for better experience)

Pagination / Scrolling Approach

The website uses a scroll-based section navigation instead of traditional page numbers.

CSS Scroll Snap is used so each section snaps cleanly into view.

JavaScript (Intersection Observer) detects the active section.

Navigation indicators (dots/menu) update automatically based on the current section.

This approach provides smooth transitions and keeps the user aware of their position on the page.

Key Design Decisions

Minimal UI: Focused on content clarity rather than heavy visuals.

Consistent Color Scheme: Professional and educational look.

Mobile-First Design: Layout adapts well to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
